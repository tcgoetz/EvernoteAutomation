## EverNote

Scripts for automating Evernote.

Service extensions that:
* Export the current note to the clipboard as simplified and cleaned up HTML.
* Export the selection from the current note to the clipboard as simplified and cleaned up HTML.

Issues these scripts adress:
* When you cut-n-paste from Evernote into an app that takes HTML, the HTML that is pasted does not render the same as in Evernote.
* There is a lot of cruft in Evernote exported HTML.
